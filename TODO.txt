* UI
    * List mission on launch site
* Fixes
    * Auto-Assign Teams should be on to start
    * Only leading edge hardware tests can reset the hardware counter
* Refactoring
* Depot improvements
    * Fuel delivery missions — send a tanker rocket to deposit propellant into a deployed depot
    * Depots, rockets, and space stations should eventually have some base interface that allows certain interactions
      between them and for them to have locations.
    * Multiple payloads per rocket, some of which might be for missions, some things like fuel depots
* Add mission time
    * Add lunar orbit mission type with small observation satellite
* Propellant endurance tracking (build on propellant remaining data).
    * Will be important later when we have multi-stage missions and propellant depots
* Places, delta-v map
    * Enhance map page with more orbit info.
    * Get delta-v map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deltavs.svg
* Add endurance to rockets
    * A big difference between GTO and GEO capable rockets
    * Consumables
    * Affects cryonic propellants
* Add electricity
    * Batteries
    * Solar panels
    * Ion drives
* Part improvements
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
    * Changes to the design of parts can introduce flaws.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * Types with no decay
        * N launches without a failure (no decay)
        * Success rate
    * Types with decay
        * First mission of N type
            * Launching to a new place
            * Bringing people to a new place
        * Technical innovations
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)
* Compare SpaceX timeline to what we can get in the game for balance.
