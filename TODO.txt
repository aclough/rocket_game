* Fixes
* UI
    * The Color of the progress bar for Rockets should be the same blue as for engines.
    * Pressing "Submit to engineering on a design should move us to the Research tab
    * [Done by human] Figure out UI for locations and refueling
* Refactoring
* Hardware rich development
    * Diminsighing returns to development over time without sacrificing hardware.
    * Mission flights or test flight work for rockets.
    * For engines or other parts a test stand is good enough.
        * By which I mean, if the productivity factor from a lack of tests is below some fraction and there is an engine
          in storage, it is removed to restore research productivity.
* Propellant endurance tracking (build on propellant remaining data).
    * Will be important later when we have multi-stage missions and propellant depots
* Places, delta-v map
    * Update map page to show these.
    * Get delta-v map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deltavs.svg
* Add endurance to rockets
    * A big difference between GTO and GEO capable rockets
    * Consumables
    * Affects cryonic propellants
* Add electricity
    * Batteries
    * Solar panels
    * Ion drives
* Part improvements
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
    * Changes to the design of parts can introduce flaws.
* Prices
    * Keep track of the number of parts and rockets built.
    * Keep track of the amount of engineering that goes into parts and engines.
    * Use these to calculate the marginal and average cost of rockts and parts.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * Types with no decay
        * N launches without a failure (no decay)
        * Success rate
    * Types with decay
        * First mission of N type
            * Launching to a new place
            * Bringing people to a new place
        * Technical innovations
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)
* Events
