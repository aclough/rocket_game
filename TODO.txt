* Create new parts
    * Made more or less complex strongly affecting price but also changing performance and reliability.
    * Complexity should be a number stored with the part instead of just being used to derive other things, we'll want more cmoplex designs to have more of a penalty when someone tries to make one on the Moon or somewhere else far away from Earth's resoruces.
* Part improvements
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Aluminium, steel, or composite tanks for rocket stages.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
* UI
    * Little guys that represent teams on the card they're assigned to.
* Prices
    * Keep track of the number of parts and rockets built.
    * Keep track of the amount of engineering that goes into parts and engines.
    * Use these to calculate the marginal and average cost of rockts and parts.
* Designs include strutural materials like steel, almuminium, or carbon composite.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * A 10, 100, etc customer launches without a failure one.
        * Test launches don't count here.
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)
* Events
