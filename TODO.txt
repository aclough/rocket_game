* UI
* Fixes
* Refactoring
* Stages
    * Stages have to track their propellant independantly
        *potentially a first stage won't completely use its fuel before the second stage starts if it's going back to the launch site.
    * Stages constructed indpendantly in the manufactury
        * We should always break
        * To make this resonable, objects in the manufactury shouldn't take floor space until their inputs are ready.
            * Check for floor space the same way we check for parts?
    * Stages should have indpendant identities so that, in the future, they can be re-used between designs like Centaur was
    * Future spacecraft will function as a final stage for a booster which might otherwise have other payloads
* Stage re-use
    * If a stage has enough propellant remaining it can return and re-appear in the manufacturing area
    * Mission planning can include saving propellant for return to the launch site.
        * Landing on boats to be added later.
    * Requires refurbishment to re-fly.  Shorter than building.
* Spacecraft
    * A new type of stage that hangs out in space for long periods of time and doesn't dissapear automatically with its mission.
    * We should distinguish between aerodynamics stages, like boosters, non-aerodynamic ones, and ones capable of re-entry
* Tourism
    * Requires spacecraft, an extra stage on top of a rocket booster
    * For now missions will be for some number of people to want to go to LEO, stay there for a week, and then return.
* Propellant endurance tracking (build on propellant remaining data).
    * Will be important later when we have multi-stage missions and propellant depots
* Places, delta-v map
    * Enhance map page with more orbit info.
    * Get delta-v map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deltavs.svg
* Add endurance to rockets
    * A big difference between GTO and GEO capable rockets
    * Consumables
    * Affects cryonic propellants
* Add electricity
    * Batteries
    * Solar panels
    * Ion drives
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Complexity adds sub-linearly for different part properties.
    * Max rather than addition maybe?  But if the same add 1.
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Add re-use to a booster that already exists
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
    * Changes to the design of parts can introduce flaws.
    * Add the abilty to improve a designs thrust per weight
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * Types with no decay
        * N launches without a failure (no decay)
        * Success rate
    * Types with decay
        * First mission of N type
            * Launching to a new place
            * Bringing people to a new place
        * Technical innovations
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)
* Compare SpaceX timeline to what we can get in the game for balance.
