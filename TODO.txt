* Fixes
* UI
* Create new part types
    * Methane, hypergolics
    * Different types of increasing chamber pressure (expander, oxygen full flow, etc)
* Rockets record how much of what sort of propellant they have, and how much they have at the end of a mission.
    * Will be important later when we have multi-stage missions and propellant depots
    * And important for endurance.
* Places, delta-v map
    * LEO, GTO, L4, etc.  Just the Earth-Moon system for now.
    * Update map page to show these.
    * Get delta-v map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Deltavs.svg
* Add endurance to rockets
    * A big difference between GTO and GEO capable rockets
    * COnsumables
    * Affects cryonic propellants
* Add electricity
    * Solar panels
    * Ion drives
* Part improvements
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
    * Changes to the design of parts can introduce flaws.
* Prices
    * Keep track of the number of parts and rockets built.
    * Keep track of the amount of engineering that goes into parts and engines.
    * Use these to calculate the marginal and average cost of rockts and parts.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * A 10, 100, etc customer launches without a failure one.
        * Test launches don't count here.
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)
* Events
