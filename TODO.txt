* Different engine types should have different flaw distributions (after user-defined engine designs are implemented).
* Create new parts
    * Double check the realism of the materials cost of engines.
    * Made more or less complex strongly affecting price but also changing performance.
    * Complexity should be a number stored with the part instead of just being used to derive other things, we'll want more cmoplex designs to have more of a penalty when someone tries to make one on the Moon or somewhere else far away from Earth's resoruces.
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Display the selected mission on the Missions page and provide a way of unselecting missions.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning.  There's the "head" of the design that gets updated continuously as engineers improve things but for manufacturing you need a "1.2" or "C" or whatever version that instantiated rockets will be tagged with.
    * You can make some changes to a design (engines, tank size) when making a new version will introduce some flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws might be fixed on the "head" but existing parts from a given version still have them.
* Finance tab:
    * Monthly expenses broken down by team (name + salary)
    * Total monthly burn rate
    * Runway remaining (money / monthly burn)
    * Prices of various inputs (raw materials, facility upgrades, propellant)
* UI
    * When trying to build a rocket without parts, the parts added should be reduced by the current inventory.
    * Little guys that represent teams on the card they're assigned to.
    * A button to auto assign manufacturing teams which finish their runs to the project with the fewest team to remaining item ratio.
    * In reseach make an estimate of how well tested a design is based on how long its been tested and how many flaws have been found.  Don't use the actual number of remaining flaws!  This is just to give players a rough guide.
        * Likewise other places where we estimate success.
* Designs include strutural materials like steel, almuminium, or carbon composite.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * A 10, 100, etc customer launches without a failure one.
        * Test launches don't count here.
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)

* Events
