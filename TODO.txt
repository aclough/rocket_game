* Fixes
    * Make "Auto Assign Teams" something that is toggled rather than a single action.
    * Add level of testing to Rocket in Research screen.
* Refining to Testing in Research
    * Testing is an activity that takes 20 work units.
    * Multiply the chance of successfully detecting a flaw by 20
* Add rockets that can't yet be built to Production
    * In addition to adding the needed items that aren't in the queue to the queue add the Rocket but don't let teams be asigned to it before the items are ready.
* Create new parts
    * Made more or less complex strongly affecting price but also changing performance and reliability.
    * Complexity should be a number stored with the part instead of just being used to derive other things, we'll want more cmoplex designs to have more of a penalty when someone tries to make one on the Moon or somewhere else far away from Earth's resoruces.
    * Refined over time for better stats with diminishing returns but benefit from flight experience
        * Things like increase chamber pressure or reduce complexity
        * This will introduce flaws.
* Aluminium, steel, or composite tanks for rocket stages.
* Save/load game (WorldSeed is already in GameState, ready to serialize)
* Design versioning improvements:
    * Making changes to a design (engines, tank size) when cutting a new version should introduce flaws depending on how large the change is.
    * Flaws fixed on the "head" should not affect existing parts from older versions.
* UI
    * Little guys that represent teams on the card they're assigned to.
* Designs include strutural materials like steel, almuminium, or carbon composite.
* Prestige system
    * A bunch of modifiers with natural decays.
    * A 10, 100, etc customer launches without a failure one.
        * Test launches don't count here.
* Tooltips
    * Income/expenses
    * Prestige
* Advertized price and capabilities affects missions
    * Mission gating with capability.
    * Demand curve for missions
* Define world fact questions to query against the WorldSeed (moon water, tech difficulty, event selection, etc.)

* Events
